            <p>Earth, our home planet, is a world unlike any other. The third planet from the sun, Earth is the only place in the 
                known universe confirmed to host life. With a radius of 3,959 miles, Earth is the fifth largest planet in our solar
                system, and it's the only one known for sure to have liquid water on its surface.
                The Earth is a very diverse and beautiful place.
                Sunsets over the ocean are a sight to behold.
                The moon gently rises across the night sky during the night.
                The Earth revolves slowly on its axis.
                Depending on where you are, the climate of the Earth varies incredibly.
                In tropical regions, it is often hot and humid with intense sunlight.
                In more northerly regions, it is cooler with weaker sunlight.
                Antarctica is one of the most pristine parts of the Earth.
                Antarctica is covered in thick ice, so we still donâ€™t know much about this mysterious continent.
